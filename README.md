# sentry-source-engine
This repository contains the files needed to implement Sentry to the Source engine. This code was published in hope that this could help developers trace player's session when crashing.

**This will contain both x64 and x86 binaries of Sentry Native.**

## How do I add this into my sourcemod?
Here's the list of things you require before you continue on this tutorial:
- A existing Sentry project (see https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/create-new-project on how to create a project)
- Source SDK 2013 code (duh)
- Visual Studio Community/Professional 2022 (you can download it here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) with Desktop development with C++ workload and C/C++ v143 MFC modules
